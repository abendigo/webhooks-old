# the package*.json file(s). This allows us to take advantage of cached Docker layers.
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied

# npm ci works similarly to npm i, but skips the expensive dependency resolution step,
# and instead just installs the exact dependencies specified in your package-lock.json file.
# Itâ€™s basically a faster npm i for use in CI environments.

# Thats it for the build side. Now, the deployable parts
